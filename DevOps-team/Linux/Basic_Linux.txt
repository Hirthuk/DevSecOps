Here's a concise set of Linux basic command notes based on your tutorial:

### **Basic Linux Commands Cheat Sheet**

#### **1. System Info & Navigation**
- `pwd` – Print current working directory (shows where you are).  
- `whoami` – Display current logged-in username.  
- `id` – Show user and group info (UID/GID).  
- `echo "text"` – Print text to terminal.  
- `echo ~` – Show path to your home directory (`/home/username`).  

#### **2. File Operations**
- `touch file.txt` – Create empty file (or update timestamp if exists).  
- `echo "text" > file.txt` – Write text to file (overwrites if exists).  
- `cat file.txt` – View file content.  
- `cp file.txt copy.txt` – Copy file.  
- `cp -r dir/ dir_copy/` – Copy directory recursively (`-r`).  
- `mv file.txt newname.txt` – Rename or move file/directory.  
- `rm file.txt` – Delete file (permanent!).  
- `rm -r dir/` – Delete directory recursively.  
- `rm -i file.txt` – Prompt before deletion (`-i`).  
- `rm -f file.txt` – Force delete (no prompts, `-f`).  

#### **3. Directory Operations**
- `mkdir dirname` – Create directory.  
- `ls` – List files/directories (non-hidden).  
- `ls -a` – List all files (including hidden `.files`).  
- `ls -l` – Detailed list (permissions, size, etc.).  
- `ls -la` – Detailed list + hidden files.  
- `ls -R dir/` – List recursively (shows subdirectory contents).  

#### **4. Hidden Files**
- Files/dirs starting with `.` are hidden (e.g., `.hiddenfile.txt`).  
- Use `ls -a` to see them.  

#### **5. File System Structure**
- `/` – Root directory (top of the hierarchy).  
- `~` – Shortcut for your home directory (`/home/username`).  

#### **6. Installing Software**
- `sudo apt install htop` – Install packages (e.g., `htop` for system monitoring).  
- `htop` – Interactive process viewer (like Task Manager).  

#### **7. Shortcuts**
- `ll` – Alias for `ls -la` (common shortcut).

### **Key Concepts**
- **Recursive (`-r`)** – Apply to directories and their contents.  
- **Hidden Files** – Prefix with `.` (e.g., `.bashrc`).  
- **Paths**:  
  - `./` – Current directory.  
  - `../` – Parent directory.  

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `rm` is permanent! Use `-i` for safety.
